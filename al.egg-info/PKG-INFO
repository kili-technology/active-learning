Description: # active-learning
        
        This repository contains code developed for [Kili Technology](https://kili-technology.com/), to investigate the use of machine learning to accelerate the training pipeline. This library mainly considers active learning.
        
        
        ## Summary
        
        The repository is divided as follows : 
        
        - In `active-learning`, you can find a library containing models, dataset, and algorithms used for active learning.
        - In `experiments`, you can find the code for different experiments ran.
        - In `notebooks`, you can find notebooks that show how the library works.
